    <p id="description">
        In 1962,with the success of the Fantastic Four,MarvelComics editor and hed writer stan lee
        was casting for a new superhero idea.he said the idea for Spider man arose from a surge in teenage 
        demand for comic books and the desire to create a character with whom teens could identify.as with Fantastic Four,Lee saw spider man
        as s opportunity to 'to get out his system 'what he felt was missing in comic books.
